Welcome to Santa's Christmas List!

Once a year, we scramble to get the perfect gift for those we care about. Instead of asking the question "What do you want this year? What is something you need?" Wouldn't is be great to have a site where our friends and/or family have already created a list of things they would like? Well, in walks in Santa's Christmas List.

DESCRIPTION: Web application for users to create their very own gift list. Users may also view the lists other users that have created lists to help aid in Christmas shopping.
